		<p>The immortal jellyfish, scientifically known as turritopsis dohrnii medusae, is a worldwide species native to tropical regions. It's said that the free-living plankton is..."one of the few known cases of animals capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual."[1]</p>
		<p>In the same phylum as T. dohrnii, a like species named hydra has regenerative qualities. The hydra organisms seem to never die of old age and never seem to age.</p>
		<p>That being said, T. dohrnii species are only "virtually immortal". They're still vulnerable due to the presence of predators, certain deseases, or even loss of habitat and food. Now how can a living creature die yet be immortal? Following such deadly events, the species is capable of transforming back into a polyp at will, which results in a new, genetically identical jellyfish.</p> <center><img id="image" src="https://thebiologist.rsb.org.uk/images/biologist/Features/Jellyfish_fig2.png" alt="Picture of Turritopsis Dohrnii Life Cycle" width="100%" height="100%"></img></center>
		<p>As Tam√°s Varga mentioned in their Earthly Mission Article, "...their tentacles retract, their bodies shrink, and they sink to the ocean floor and start the cycle all over again."[2]</p>
		<p>In theory, this process can continue on indefinitely, yet T. dohrnii are still able to die. In nature, the T. dohrnii are more likely to succumb to disease or predation in the medusa stage without reverting to the polyp stage. A change which would cause them to die at the sexually mature stage. As an animal, it's usual to adapt & survive in unforseen environments, but to be able to reset when facing imminent threat, is biologically intriguing. </p>
